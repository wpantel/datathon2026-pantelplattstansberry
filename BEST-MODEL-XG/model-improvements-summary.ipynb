    "This notebook documents the systematic improvements made to our air quality prediction model. Our initial XGBoost model achieved an R² of 0.235, explaining only 23.5% of the variance in median AQI values. Through feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and proper data preprocessing, we improved performance to R² of 0.534, more than doubling our model's predictive power.\n",

    "## 12. Summary of Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Changed:\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Created 11 new features capturing interactions, non-linear relationships, and domain-specific patterns\n",
    "2. **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoded geographic regions to capture location-specific patterns\n",
    "3. **Robust Scaling**: Used RobustScaler instead of StandardScaler for outlier resistance\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically searched 192 parameter combinations using GridSearchCV\n",
    "5. **Cross-Validation**: Implemented 5-fold CV for robust parameter selection and model validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- **Original R²**: 0.235 (23.5% variance explained)\n",
    "- **Final R²**: 0.534 (53.4% variance explained)\n",
    "- **Improvement**: +127% increase in explained variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "- Feature engineering had the largest impact, particularly interaction features combining demographics with economic and density metrics\n",
    "- Geographic encoding (Region/Division) captured important location-specific air quality patterns\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning with proper regularization prevented overfitting on our relatively small dataset\n",
    "- The model now explains more than half of the variance in air quality, a substantial improvement for practical applications"
